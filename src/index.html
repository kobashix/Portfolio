                <summary>Why should we hire you to be the Controller for our company?</summary>
                <p>With 12 years of experience in financial leadership roles across the higher education, government,
                  and tourism sectors, I have honed my expertise in steering organizations through diverse fiscal
                  landscapes. My journey has seen me adeptly transition from overseeing a robust team of bookkeepers and
                  accountants to excelling in environments with leaner staff structures. In every capacity, I have
                  consistently met and surpassed the operational needs of my employers.<br>
                  <br>My adaptability is a cornerstone of my professional ethos, allowing me to seamlessly integrate
                  into
                  any corporate culture and work harmoniously with various teams. I am committed to not only fulfilling
                  my designated responsibilities but also to contributing to the broader success of the organization. My
                  proactive approach ensures that I consistently strive for excellence, aiming to elevate the company’s
                  performance to its highest potential.

                <summary>Why should we hire you to work for our SaaS company?</summary>
                <p>My proficiency in accounting truly comes to the forefront in its technical facets. I excel in
                  executing integrations and navigating software transitions, areas that I consider among my core
                  competencies. As the proprietor of a consulting firm, I adeptly managed an extensive portfolio of over
                  200 domain names, maintained upwards of 20 WordPress blogs, and oversaw numerous monthly Software as a
                  Service (SaaS) contracts.
                  <br>
                  <br>My technical acumen extends to both the front-end and back-end dimensions of website development,
                  encompassing website design, search engine optimization (SEO), and mastery of HTML/CSS. On the server
                  side, I am well-versed in PHP, JavaScript, and database management using MySQL/MongoDB, along with
                  programming in Python. This comprehensive experience has endowed me with a deep understanding of the
                  unique challenges and requirements inherent to SaaS businesses.

                <summary>Why should we select you over our many other candidates?</summary>
                <p>My distinctive edge lies in my affinity for collaborating with small businesses. Engaging my services
                  is tantamount to acquiring a multifaceted team of a Controller, data analyst, financial analyst, and
                  accountant II—all in one. I bring to the table a profound comprehension of the comprehensive landscape
                  of financial reporting, coupled with the acumen to procure the precise data essential for informed
                  decision-making, propelling your business to the forefront of its industry.
                  <br>
                  <br>I leverage cutting-edge technology—including artificial intelligence (AI), advanced software
                  solutions, and occasionally hardware—to streamline operations, thereby obviating the need for
                  additional personnel. My keen insight into your business’s specific needs ensures that I provide
                  tailored, efficient, and cost-effective financial strategies.

                <summary>What ERP/Accounting Software do you have experience with?</summary>
                <p>Throughout my extensive career as an accountant, I have engaged with a diverse array of accounting
                  software, enhancing my adaptability and expertise in the field. My journey commenced with QuickBooks
                  Desktop, transitioning to QuickBooks Online upon its introduction. With over two decades of experience
                  utilizing QuickBooks, I have developed a profound proficiency in its application.<br>

                  <br>My tenure at Magic Springs was marked by a significant contribution to the integration of
                  NetSuite,
                  succeeding an AS400 system, an endeavor that enriched my NetSuite expertise over six years. As a
                  consultant, my primary tool was QuickBooks Online; however, my role extended to facilitating the
                  integration of various financial systems, including Sage Intacct, Peachtree, SAP Financial Accounting,
                  Workday, Ellucian Banner, and several proprietary systems.
                  <br>
                  <br>In my capacity at the Garland County Sheriff’s Office, I adeptly managed a proprietary system
                  tailored for government operations. Similarly, at National Park College, I navigated the complexities
                  of PeopleSoft financials, an Oracle-based system.<br>
                  <br>My foundational knowledge in software programming has empowered me to seamlessly adapt to diverse
                  accounting, payroll, CRM, and ERP systems. This versatility is further exemplified by my recent
                  endeavors in mastering HubSpot CRM, Paylocity HRMS, and Chargebee’s subscription management system,
                  underscoring my commitment to continuous learning and professional development in the dynamic
                  landscape of financial technology.
